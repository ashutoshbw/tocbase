# ToC Base

A JavaScript library for quickly creating a table of contents inside the browser.

## Features
- Has out-of-the-box support for adding anchors to headings, automatic numbering to them, adding custom class names, and many more. 
- Has no CSS or predefined class names and thus gives you complete freedom to style it your way.
- It has two levels of configuration, global and page specific. Thus you can tweak the ToC, for example, on blog posts or documentation pages, and inherit the global config on each page.
- It has a nested plugin system in-built. That means a plugin can have other sub-plugins. It is super easy to write a plugin if you want to extend it.
- Size is less than 1.5 kb (minimized + gzipped).
